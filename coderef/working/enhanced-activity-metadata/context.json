  "description": "Enhance Recent Activity card to show meaningful metadata for ALL scraper types instead of just generic \"X rows updated\" messages",
  "goal": "Users can see what was actually scraped (weeks, teams, types) in the Recent Activity card for all table types",
  "requirements": [
    "Show week ranges for game-related tables (games, live_plays, live_drives, win_probability)",
    "Show video_type counts for game_videos (e.g., '90 highlights')",
    "Show team counts for player_injuries",
    "Show transaction_type breakdown for roster_transactions",
    "Aggregate metadata from batch updates (not just 5 rows)",
    "Display contextual descriptions like '90 highlights (Weeks 5-11)' instead of '90 rows updated'"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [],
  "constraints": [
    "Must maintain existing filter functionality",
    "Keep performance reasonable (don't fetch entire tables)",
    "Handle missing metadata gracefully"
